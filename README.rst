Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit
====================================

The Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST) is a simple, fully
automated 3D medical imaging segmentation framework for PyTorch and
TensorFlow. MIST allows researchers to quickly set up, train, and test
various deep learning models for 3D medical imaging segmentation.

For documentation on how to run either the PyTorch or TensorFlow
implementations, please see the following
